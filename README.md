# dqsim
A simple C++ project using OOP. CLI only

All characters and creative aspects are not my own. I am taking inspiration from Square Enix's DQXI for all names and concepts. 

## TODO
* Rename functions (eg getHp and getMp -> getCurHp, getCurMp)
* Restructure function arguments for getting caster/attacker name (currently passing a reference - maybe just pass a string?)
* Reorder & cleanup .h files for better visibility
* <b>Allow enemies to cast spells </b>
* <b>Implement multi-target spells</b>

Additionally, check comments for more tasks. Might want to restructure how battle happens
